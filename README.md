# ScottPlot-CPP
A (very basic) port of ScottPlot to C++, currently runs exclusively on Windows. This is a hobby project. It lacks most of ScottPlot's features. If you need a C++ plotting library, I suggest this matplotlib port: https://github.com/lava/matplotlib-cpp or a library written originally for C/C++.

# Contribution
Contribute if you feel like it. I am not a C++ programmer so I'm sure some of my code is questionable.
